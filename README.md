# Statiq Framework

Statiq Framework is a flexible and extensible static content generation framework for .NET. This project is an evolution of [Wyam](https://wyam.io) and will be released later in 2019.

You may still find references to Wyam in the documentation in this repository. Those references will gradually be cleaned up and updated.
