# 1.0.0

- **[Breaking Change]** Statiq Framework version 1.0 is an exhaustive refactoring of Wyam, please read the blog post at ... for details.
- Client app/existing recipes moved to Splashdown
- Wyam.App added
- Target for libraries changed from netstandard to netcoreapp
- Wyam.Configuration removed
- Module execution is now async, plumbing throughout
- New config delegate types for document configs, removal of context config (use normal types, get context when adding modules)
- Removed named modules APIs
- Removed IPipeline.ProcessDocumentsOnce and related plumbing
- Split Execute module into Execute, ExecuteDocument, and ExecuteContext
- Pipelines no longer start with an empty initial document (this was important before the execution context provided access to settings but it no longer needed)
- New `CacheDocuments` module to handle caching between executions
- New content provider API for document content
- Removed file metadata keys and replaced with uses of `IDocument.Source` and `IDocument.Destination` (which gets set to the relative path initially) - Keys.SourceFilePath = IDocument.Source, Keys.RelativeFilePath = IDocument.Destination
- New `SetDestination` module to set `IDocument.Destination` and removed path tweaking from `WriteFiles` module (use `SetDestination` before `WriteFiles` to change destination path)
- Container modules no longer implement `IModuleList` directly, instead they have a `Children` property (removes ambiguity when an `IModuleList` is expected)
- Added `IDocument.Version` to indicate how many times a given document has been cloned (each clone incremented the version) - useful for debugging
- Paths now collapse by default
- Path segments now use `ReadOnlyMemory<char>` and are slices of the full path for reduced string allocations and memory consumption
- Removed support for multiple file providers from paths, each path now refers specifically to a location on disk
- Pipelines execute in four phase: input, process, transform, output
- Documents are not longer tracked by the execution context and calling `IExecutionContext.GetDocument()` is no longer required (though it's still preferred in order to populate documents with default settings metadata)
- Cloning a document is now performed with `IDocument.Clone()` overloads
- Documents now provide the value of their public properties when no metadata exists for the given key (making custom document types much more useful)
- A new `ObjectDocument` document type and corresponding `.ToDocument()` and `.ToDocuments()` extensions provide wrapping capability for any object
